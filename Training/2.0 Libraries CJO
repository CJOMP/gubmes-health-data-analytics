# Libraries

To start us getting familiar with some useful data science libraries we will need to know manipulate data. For this we will be using NumPy and Pandas libraries. 

### Task 1: 

Import the numpy library and make a key word for it: np 
Import the pandas library and make a key word for it: pd

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Task 2
Make a two-dimensional numpy array. First row will be: [1,2,3] and second row will be [4,5,6]. 
Using numpy functionality find the mean, minimum and max value of your array. Index the maximum value and assign it to a variable named max. Index the minimum value and assign it to a variable named min. 

```
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

mean = np.mean(x)
minimum = np.min(x)
maximum = np.max(x)

max = np.argmax(x)
min = np.argmin(x)
```


### Task 3

Create a DataFrame using the Pandas library. Your DataFrame should represent the table shown below: 

[Patient_table.pdf](https://github.com/SoFia2401/gubmes-health-data-analytics/files/7404366/Patient_table.pdf)


```
# Creating patient_details  
patient_details = {'Patient': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'Age': [50, 60, 70], 'Heart Condition': ['Arrhythmia', 'Heart failure', 'Unstable angina']}  
  
# Creating DataFrame  
df = pd.DataFrame(patient_details)
```

### Task 4
Normally we would want to be able to extract the information form tables directly into our DataFrame. The Pandas library allows us to do this through one of its functionalities. Find out what this functionality is and read the csv file named 'Training2_example' found in the resources folder or down below:

[Training2_example.csv](https://github.com/SoFia2401/gubmes-health-data-analytics/files/7404392/Training2_example.csv)

```
data = np.loadtxt('Training2_example.csv',delimiter = ',')
```
