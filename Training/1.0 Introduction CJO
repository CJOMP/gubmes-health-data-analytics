1.0 Introduction CJO

### Task 1: all data types in Python with examples.
```
1) Text Type: str
2) Numeric Types: int, float, complex
3) Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
4) Mapping Type: dict
5) Set Types: set, frozenset
6) Boolean Type: bool
7) Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
```

### Task 2: storing data in list, arrays and tuples and assigning them to the variables a, b and c respectively.
```
a = list(("UofG", "HDA", "Project")) #using list constructor
b = ["Github", "Python", "Training"]
c = (True, 2021, "fun")
```

### Task 3: a statement where the summation of a variable x+1 will be calculated if the value of x is greater than 2.
```
x = 0
if x<2:
    xsummation = x + 1
```
Incorporating a for loop to calculate the value of n(x+1) for n repetitions where n=3 and storing each value of the for loop in an array named y.
```
n = 3
y = []
for i in range(0,n):
    calculation = n*(xsummation)
    y.append(calculation)
```
#INSERT CODE HERE 
Task 4: Functions allow us to compute processes much faster without having to repeat lines of code. Using code from Task 3, we create a function called 'my_cool_function', which takes in the value x and will compute the n(x+1) if x is greater than 2 and for n repetitions where values will be stored in an array named y. This function will return y.
```
def my_cool_function():
    x = input("Please enter an integer:")   
    if x>2:
        n = 3
        y = []
        for i in range(0,n):
            calculation = n*(x +1)
            y.append(calculation)
    return y
```
That is my first introductory python coding assignment completed!
